Check updates for packages in a haskell snapshot, using `stack`.

# Use

    > stackshot --input _infile_ --output _outfile_

Take a snapshot _infile_ and produce a list of packages in _outfile_.

Handles some github packages.

Note that github packages will not be produced in the output â€” sadly these must be checked manually.
